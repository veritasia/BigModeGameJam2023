# Game Mode: Switch!

Game Mode: Switch is our project for the Big Mode Game Jam hosted on Itch and tells the tale of Jay, a gamer who is isekai'd and wants to go home but in order to go home, they must beat the game.
In terms of gameplay, there are 3 different modes that Jay can be in:
- Survival mode where Jay can collect items and interact with the environment
- Action mode where Jay can swing their sword and shoot fireballs
- And last, but not least, Platformer Mode where Jay jumps from bush to bush, avoiding enemies along the way
